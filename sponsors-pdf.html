				<h2>About BarCamp Manchester 3</h2>
				<p>BarCamp Manchester 3 is an open, free-to-attend, participatory 1-day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a>. Unconferences differ from normal conferences in that the schedule is created and filled by the attendees with everyone running a session or talk about whatever subject they have a passion for. From Cocktail Making to Programming for Beginners, from Arduino Hacking to Photography, BarCamps attract people from all sorts of backgrounds, each sharing their expertise and experiences.</p>
				<p>BarCamp attendees come from all walks of life and ages 8-80; what they have in common is a passion for stimulating conversations and expanding their own knowledge. They love to give back to the community and a BarCamp is the perfect place to do this. BarCamp attendees are not only the great thinkers of today, but the great thinkers of tomorrow. They are excited by the diversity of discussions and insights that are achieved in the intellectual melting pot that is BarCamp.</p>
				<p>Previous BarCamps have received widespread online media coverage, with attendees tweeting throughout the day, live blogging the sessions, and afterwards sharing photos and videos online.</p>
				<h2>Sponsorship Opportunities</h2>
				<p>The BarCamp Manchester planning team are looking for sponsors to make the event possible. Due to the nature of the event there are a number of costs incurred which make great sponsorship opportunities for local businesses, regional tech/industry companies and international companies looking to increase their exposure amongst the active Manchester community.</p>
				<p>In return for their support of sponsors of BarCamp Manchester 3 will receive:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Presence on the website; logo, link and short description</li>
					<li>Presence at the venue: logo on posters</li>
					<li>Space for larger sponsors to put up their own signage for display the event</li>
					<li>Praise throughout the weekend</li>
					<li>Space for sponsors to bring along items to give away</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Sponsors typically donate between £250 and £1000. Ideally, sponsors will be able to pay for items directly, as this helps with accounting. We can discuss exactly how this will work and address any questions you have.</p>
				<p>Sponsors are encouraged to attend and participate in the BarCamp, holding interesting, passionate talks, and taking the time to talk face-to-face with the BarCamp community.</p>
				<h2>Micro Sponsorship</h2>
				<p>Along side of the main sponsorship packages we are accepting help from micro-sponsors, these would usually be freelancers, small companies or individuals.</p>
