				<h2>About BarCamp Manchester 2</h2>
				<p>BarCamp Manchester 2 is an open, free-to-attend, participatory 2-day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a>. Unconferences differ from normal conferences in that the schedule is created and filled by the attendees with everyone running a session or talk about whatever subject they have a passion for. From Cocktail Making to Programming for Beginners, from Arduino Hacking to Photography, BarCamps attract people from all sorts of backgrounds, each sharing their expertise and experiences.</p>
				<p>BarCamp attendees come from all walks of life and ages 8-80; what they have in common is a passion for stimulating conversations and expanding their own knowledge. They love to give back to the community and a BarCamp is the perfect place to do this. BarCamp attendees are not only the great thinkers of today, but the great thinkers of tomorrow. They are excited by the diversity of discussions and insights that are achieved in the intellectual melting pot that is BarCamp.</p>
				<p>Previous BarCamps have received widespread online media coverage, with attendees tweeting throughout the day, live blogging the sessions, and afterwards sharing photos and videos online.</p>
